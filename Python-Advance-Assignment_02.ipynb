    "Q1. What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "Ans: A Python class is like an outline/blueprint/mold for creating a new object. \n",
    "    An object is anything that you wish to manipulate or change while working through the code.\n",
    "    Every time a class object is instantiated, which is when we declare a variable, a new object\n",
    "    is initiated from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas in Python, Modules are simply files with the .py extension containing \n",
    "Python code that can be imported inside another Python Program. In simple terms,\n",

    "Q2. How do you make instances and classes?\n",
    "Ans: For creating a class instance. we call a class by its name and pass \n",
